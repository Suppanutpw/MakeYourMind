# Make Your Mine

This project was created to be used in the study of programming and for use in  PSIT(Problem Solving in Information Technology. The content is based on `5-step solution.`

**5-Step solution**

- [Analyze the data](#analyzethedata)

## Define the problem
- What are you trying to solve? In addition to getting clear on what the problem is, defining the problem also establishes a goal for what you want to achieve.
- Input: something is wrong or something could be improved.
- Output: a clear definition of the opportunity and a goal for fixing it.

## Assume the problem
- What are some ways to solve the problem? The goal is to create a list of possible solutions to choose from. The harder the problem, the more solutions you may need.

- Input: a goal; research of the problem and possible solutions; imagination.
- Output: pick-list of possible solutions that would achieve the stated goal.

## Collect the data
- What are you going to do? The ideal solution is effective (it will meet the goal), efficient (is affordable), and has the fewest side effects (limited consequences from implementation).

- Input: pick-list of possible solutions; decision-making criteria.
- Output:decision of what solution you will implement.

## Analyze the data
- What are you doing? The implementation of a solution requires planning and execution. It’s often iterative, where the focus should be on short implementation cycles with testing and feedback, not trying to get it “perfect” the first time.

- Input: decision; planning; hard work.
- Output: resolution to the problem.

## Conclude and Learning summary
- What did you do? To know you successfully solved the problem, it’s important to review what worked, what didn’t and what impact the solution had. It also helps you improve long-term problem solving skills and keeps you from re-inventing the wheel.

- Input: resolutions; results of the implementation.
- Output: insights; case-studies; bullets on your resume.
